Tag: scrapy, spider, company

## 1. Background

&nbsp;&nbsp; Crawl down infomation from [jobui](http://www.jobui.com/). I've used scrapy before for crawling medical corpuses. But sadly I made few notes in the entire work so that I could hardly restart a project. It taught me if you want remember more, just write down.


## 2. Install

```
pip install scrapy
```

## 3. Start from zero

&nbsp;&nbsp; By running

```
scrapy startproject jobui
```
we get a simple construction of scrapy project.

```
spiders[folder]
items.py
pipelines.py
settings.py
```
